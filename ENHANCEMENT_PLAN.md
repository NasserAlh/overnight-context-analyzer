## Implementation Strategy

### Safe Enhancement Principles

#### 1. Feature Flag Architecture
```java
// Example feature flag implementation
public class FeatureFlags {
    public static final boolean ENHANCED_LOGGING = false;
    public static final boolean MULTI_TIMEFRAME_VWAP = false;
    public static final boolean PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS = false;
}
```

#### 2. Parallel Calculation Approach
- Run new calculations alongside existing ones
- Compare results without affecting current output
- Only activate when thoroughly validated
- Maintain performance benchmarks

#### 3. Backward Compatibility Guarantee
- Keep existing CSV format as default option
- Maintain original scoring methods
- Preserve current export timing and file naming
- Ensure existing MotiveWave settings continue working
